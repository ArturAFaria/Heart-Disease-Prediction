# ðŸš€ Heart-Disease-Prediction

<h1 align="center">ðŸ“„ Project Background</h1>
Predicting the condition of a patient in the case of heart disease is important. It would be good if a patient could get to know the condition before itself rather than visiting the doctor. Patients spend a significant amount of time trying to get an appointment with doctors. After they get the appointment, they would have to give a lot of tests.

<h1 align="center">ðŸ“„ Methodology</h1>

1.Data

Some of the input features that would be considered in this example are blood pressure, chest pain type and cholestrol levels. This is just a sample dataset with 303 rows. This is created just to understand different classification machine learning algorithms and sklearn implementation of them. Below is the link where you can find the source of the data. Thanks to 'kaggle' for providing this data.

2.Machine Learning Models

There were many machine learning models used in the process of predicting the heart diseases. Below are the models that were used in the process of predicting heart diseases.

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
Accuracy achieved: 88% (Random Forest)

3. Outcomes

   Based on the results generated, it could be seen that the Random Forest model was performing the best in terms of the F1 score, precision, and recall respectively.

   Random Forest model was also having the highest accuracy in terms of classifying whether a person would have a heart disease or not.
