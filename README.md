# ðŸš€ Heart-Disease-Prediction

<h1 align="center">ðŸ“„ Project Background</h1>
Heart Diseases are too risky for a human being, from a given data we will predict that person have heart disease or not with the help of Machine Learning. 
Preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

<h1 align="center">ðŸ“„ Methodology</h1>

1. Data collection methodology
- Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

2. I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
Accuracy achieved: 88% (Random Forest)
